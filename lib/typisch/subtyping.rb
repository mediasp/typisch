class Typisch::Type
  class << self
    # The core of the subtyping algorithm, which copes with equi-recursive types.
    #
    # Actually quite simple on the face of it -- or at least, short.
    #
    # The crucial thing is that we allow a goal to be assumed without proof during
    # the proving of its subgoals. Since (because of the potentially recursive nature
    # of types) those subgoals may refer to types from the parent goal, we could otherwise
    # run into infinite loops.
    #
    # How's that justified from a logic perspective? well, what we're doing is,
    # we're just checking that the given subtyping judgement *isn't* provably
    # *false* under the inference rules at hand. This allows a maximal consistent
    # set of subtyping judgements to be made.
    #
    # Its dual, requiring that the judgement *is* provably *true* under the inference
    # rules, would only allow a minimal set to be proven, and could get stuck
    # searching forever for a proof of those judgements which are neither provably false
    # nor provably true (namely, the awkward recursive ones).
    #
    # See Pierce on equi-recursive types and subtyping for the theory:
    # http://www.cis.upenn.edu/~bcpierce/tapl/, it's an application of
    # http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knasterâ€“Tarski_theorem to show that this
    # is a least fixed point with respect to the adding of extra inferences
    # to a set of subtyping judgements, if you note that those inference rules
    # are monotonic. 'Corecursion' / 'coinduction' are also terms for what's
    # going on here.
    #
    # TODO: for best performance, should we be going depth-first or breadth-first here?
    #
    # Also TODO: when subtype? succeeds (returns true), we can safely save the resulting
    # set of judgements that were shown to be consistent, for use during future calls to
    # subtype?. Memoization essentially.
