type-checking
  - to a certain depth?
  - protocol for registering different ruby implementations of a type for type-checking ?

easy ways to make supertypes / subtypes from existing types

registry for naming types so recursive stuff can be done
  - maybe this can also be the home of a nice DSL for declaring them

compute unions and intersections
  - make this work in combo with recursion

maybe split off generic code relating to lattices, posets etc
